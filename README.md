# Projects from my experiments (In Progress).

If you are interested in research and development, then we have a lot in common. Out of my curiosity about how things work and how to think about things. I undertook this journey.

In my journey and experimentation as a cybersecurity graduate student, I have completed the following projects:

- [Web Scraper](web_scraping.py)
In my experiments, I scapped a free-to-explore website [Bookstoscrape.com](https://books.toscrape.com/index.html) and exracted the title and price of each book.

- [Ip Finder](find_ip.py)
In my experiments, I wrote a simple script that finds the IP address of a website
